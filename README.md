## 🎮 Activity 1: Simple Scene with a Moving Node
**Date:** February 2026

### Description
This project demonstrates a basic Godot 2D scene featuring a "Hello World" label and a Sprite2D node that moves programmatically using GDScript. 

### Features
- **Hello World:** A standard text label displayed on the scene.
- **Automated Movement:** A Sprite2D node (Godot Icon) moves across the screen at a fixed speed and resets position when it goes off-screen.
- **Scripting:** Uses `_process(delta)` to update coordinates every frame.
